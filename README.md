## üíª This project is built with

- [React.js](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) for frontend and API fetch
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/): for backend

## If I had more time

If I had more time, I would have work on a job suggestions engine that would be able to suggest jobs that match the user profile.
Then I would have the possibility to display the compatibilities of the user in a detailed and explicit way in order to allow the user to make a right choice on jobs he has more chances of being selected for.
Finally I would have the possibility to display the available jobs that match the profile of the person sought, a boosted search engine capable of proposing the jobs in relation to the user profile.
